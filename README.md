# TODO APP
## An mvp JS Todo App

### What is this app for?
This is an mvp todo app. Using it, you can add tasks, update the tasks status and delete tasks. It is written in JavaScript and used as an example in my course at [Coding Bootcamps Europe](https://coding-bootcamps.eu).

### How to use this app?
To make this app functional, you first need to clone [this repository](https://github.com/coding-bootcamps-eu/todo-api) locally. This is the API we are connecting our app to. To start the API's server, ``cd`` into the cloned repository, run ``npm install`` to install all dependencies and then ``npm start`` to start the local server. You can then access the API via ``localhost`` on ``http://localhost:4730/todos``.
